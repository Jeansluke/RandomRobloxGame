# RandomRobloxGame
This is the generator that is also in the discord bot

⚠️⚠️If you want to use the already ready file with the .exe install RandomRobloxGame⚠️⚠️

⚠️⚠️And if you want use the opensource version of the script than install RandomRobloxGameOpenSource⚠️⚠️

⚠️⚠️FOR OPENSOURCE PEOPLE I WILL NOT BE HELPING YOU WITH THE IMPORTS SO THE PIP INSTALLS (the normal exported .exe does not need any pip installs)⚠️⚠️

BTW it might take some time to start up

And if it lags with get roblox game button once you clicked it thats not a bug just wait beacuse it needs to take the game from the roblox games api and that api is very slow to load try it out for your self  "https://games.roblox.com/v1/games/list?sortOrder=Random" 

And dont move anyfiles that are in the script otherwise it will break

And to open the script you need to open the .exe in "RandomRobloxGame\dist"

⚠️⚠️AND I WILL NOT BE FIXING ANY CODE I JUST WANT TO RELEASE THIS⚠️⚠️
